Python bindings for FastBit

requirements:
- Cython (built using v0.12.1)
- Fastbit (built using fastbit-ibis1.1.6)

INSTALLATION

1. get and install FastBit http://crd.lbl.gov/~kewu/fastbit/

   i've found it requires gcc-4.2 or later to compile OK. 

2. unpack the pyfastbit bindings under the fastbit source's top level
   directory.

3. run 'make' to generate the bindings. 'make install' will install them
   for you.

TODO

fix bugs, go release.
